classic titanic dataset

Titanic dataset is a classic dataset beginners start with.
I remembered my first draft was pretty messy and lack of many optimisations.

I re-attempted this classic, adopting techniques such as cross validation, parameter optimising using gridsearch, voting ensemble method, pipelines and columntransformers.
